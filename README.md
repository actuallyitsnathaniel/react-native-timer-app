# react-native-timer-app
A simple and sweet timer app similar to iOS, built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). Learned through [Spencer Carli's React Native School](https://learn.reactnativeschool.com/) (2019).  
⚠️ This app's dependencies are either deprecated or long overdue for an update. It's quite likely that upon cloning this repo, it _will not work._ ⚠️
